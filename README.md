# Simple-Weather
This project is an Android application used to show the weather with a pleasent UI. This simple weather app uses OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data for different time intervals (five days, one day, and three hours). It includes a custom AsyncTask for retrieving the user's location and another custom AsyncTask for fetching weather data based on location and time. You have also implemented a Manage Location activity that allows the user to edit and remove locations from SharedPreferences. The app's UI is designed using Canva and Figma, with a scrollable main activity that displays weather details and a NavigationView on the left for displaying recent searched locations. Overall, your weather app is a functional and user-friendly tool for checking weather information.
